TODO:
- handle errors of following functions:
    - pipe (on error, returns -1)
    - fork (on error, pid < 0)
    - execvp (on error, returns -1)
    - waitpid (on error, returns -1)
    - open (on error, returns -1)
    - dup2 (?)

open questions:
- run in background - do I need to suppress the stdout ??
